# Better canvas lock

Experimental plugin for Obsidian, that lock the "view" of canvas. You can disable:
- Zoom
- Selection of canvas 
- Drag and drop of canvas

For the moment, scrolling is not disabled, as I don't found how to do that. 

It will monkey-patch the lock function using `monkey-around`, so you just need to enable the plugin to make it work.

## ⚙️ Usage

## 📥 Installation

- [ ] From Obsidian's community plugins
- [x] Using BRAT with `https://github.com/lisandra-dev/obsidian-better-canvas-lock`

- Unzip `better-canvas-lock.zip` in `.obsidian/plugins/` path

To start building the plugin with what mode enabled run the following command:

```
pnpm run dev
```

> **Note**
> If you haven't already installed the hot-reload-plugin you'll be prompted to. You need to enable that plugin in your obsidian vault before hot-reloading will start. You might need to refresh your plugin list for it to show up.
